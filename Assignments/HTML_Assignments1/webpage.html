            challenges is irresistible. The idea of building and managing scalable systems that drive our digital world?

        <p>
            So, here I am at AltSchool Africa—excited, a little lost, kinda confused, and riding the rollercoaster of 
            "wow" and "oh" moments. But hey, isn’t that what growth is all about? Let’s do this!

        <p>

            design, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure effectively. I want to develop hands-on expertise
